Creates a character that can be moved around the screen (and between different backgrounds) with both the ASWD keys and the arrow keys, with idle head animation. If you just click your mouse within the character's torso, the character's expression will change, their eyes follow the cursor, and if you click the mouse and the control button at the same time the character will flap their arms.
	ASWD, arrows - move character
	Mouse click + CTRL = flapping arms (as long as both are pressed)
	Mouse click inside character's torso = expression changes (smiles!)
	Eyes follow the cursor
	ESC key closes the window
Be sure the working directory is set to the base directory in which main.css resides before running (this ensures background images are properly imported)

7 - lab was pretty helpful, required some additional experimentation
8 - pretty fun, the questions were super confusing (not sure I still understand them)

Questions:
1. I am not sure how to do the math behind this, I will ask Dr. Paone about it Friday
