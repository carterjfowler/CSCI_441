1. A resolution of 12 makes a pretty curve, but I prefer to set it at 15 it is much smoother than 12.

2. No, because there may be a situation in which we want to see more lines on the curve, but even in that situation we want the sphere to be animated smoothly that way it doesn't jerk between different points on a low resolution curve. In addition, we want the sphere's speed to be independent of the curves resolution.

3. 8, pretty fun!

4. Write up felt pretty good, had a few questions but mostly came down to stuff that the write up shouldn't have had to explain (weird bugs, where code should go, etc).

5. A little under 3 hours, probably closer to 2.5

6. Nope
