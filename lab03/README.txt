Carter Fowler - Aethon Misty

1. 9, Step 1 was a little confusing, but the overall really fun

2. Step 1 felt a little vague, but I think that was just cause I wasn't used to some of the language, but once I understood step 1, the rest of it was really straight forward.

3. A little over 2 hours

4. Love the model!!
