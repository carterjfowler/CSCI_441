1. The quad now has the mines logo stacked vertically 3 times

2. There is now a warping effect as the quad tries to fit 3 images of the mines logo horizontally as it reaches the top. Almost as if you had a 3x3 of mines logos, and then pulled the top row in closer.

3. 10

4. Write up was good, only had a few questions and some were just me missing something pretty obvious.

5. Around an hour and a half

6. Nope
