A3

3D environment with buildings and my character model, which can be moved using the WASD keys. Scene is viewed with both an arcball camera and freecam. Arcball is centered around the character model, the freecam is the FPOV of the character seen in the upper right hand corner of the display.

Usage Section:
	W and S keys to move character forward/backward
	A and D keys to turn character
	Click and drag mouse to move main camera
	Ctrl + click and drag mouse to zoom the main camera
	ESC or Q to close window

This was written on a Mac, if you are compiling on a Windows, don't forget to change the last line of the CMakeLists.txt file

Tried to get a skyCam working, but couldn't make its position update properly, zoom is a little finicky

Probably at least 9 hours, can't remember for sure

8, gave me a great jumping off point, took a little bit of time to figure out how the character should be translated and rotated, longest part was getting picture in picture to work

9, fun to see the result but just happened during a stressful week.
